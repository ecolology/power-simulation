# Introduction to Simulations for Power Analysis

A presentation/workshop for the JCU CodeR group on 18 July 2022. Live presentation will be uploaded to github shortly, but see the R scripts above to conduct your own power analyses.

Making many references to a previous presentation of mine, found [here](https://github.com/ecolology/causality-presentation).
Inspired by [this workshop](https://malikaihle.github.io/Introduction-Simulations-in-R/) by Malika Ihle.
